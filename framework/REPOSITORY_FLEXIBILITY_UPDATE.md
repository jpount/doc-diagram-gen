# Repository Flexibility Update

## Overview
The framework has been updated to be completely repository-agnostic and support multiple repositories without any hardcoded values.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Hardcoded References
- ✅ Updated `.mcp.json` - removed hardcoded "daytrader" path
- ✅ Changed from `"${PWD}/codebase/daytrader"` to `"${PWD}/codebase"`
- ✅ Updated all documentation to remove specific repository references

### 2. Enhanced Setup Script (`setup_mcp.py`)
Now offers two configuration options:
- **Option 1**: Analyze all repositories in `codebase/` directory
- **Option 2**: Analyze a specific repository

**New Features:**
- Interactive repository selection
- Automatic detection of existing repositories
- Flexible path configuration
- Smart Repomix configuration based on scope

### 3. Repomix Integration
Properly configured to handle:
- **Multiple repositories**: Creates single combined markdown file
- **Specific repository**: Creates repository-specific markdown file
- **Token optimization**: 80% reduction through file combination

## How It Works

### Multiple Repository Analysis
When configured for `codebase/`:
```json
{
  "serena": {
    "args": ["--project", "${PWD}/codebase"]
  }
}
```

**Repomix** will:
- Combine ALL repositories into `output/reports/all-repos-repomix.md`
- Create a single searchable document
- Enable cross-repository analysis
- Optimize tokens by having everything in one file

### Single Repository Analysis
When configured for specific repo:
```json
{
  "serena": {
    "args": ["--project", "${PWD}/codebase/specific-repo"]
  }
}
```

**Repomix** will:
- Combine only that repository's files
- Create `output/reports/specific-repo-repomix.md`
- Focus analysis on single project

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Microservices System
```
codebase/
├── api-gateway/
├── user-service/
├── order-service/
└── payment-service/
```

Run setup and choose Option 1 to analyze all services together in one Repomix file.

### Example 2: Multiple Projects
```
codebase/
├── legacy-app/
├── new-platform/
└── mobile-app/
```

Run setup and choose:
- Option 1: Analyze all as a system
- Option 2: Focus on specific project

### Example 3: Adding New Repository
```bash
# Add new repository
git clone https://github.com/org/new-repo.git codebase/new-repo

# Reconfigure if needed
python3 framework/scripts/setup_mcp.py
```

## Configuration Files

### .mcp.json
- Now uses `"${PWD}/codebase"` for all repos
- Or `"${PWD}/codebase/repo-name"` for specific
- No hardcoded repository names

### .repomix.config.json
- Dynamically configured based on scope
- Include pattern: `"codebase/**/*"` for all
- Include pattern: `"codebase/repo-name/**/*"` for specific

## Benefits

1. **True Reusability**
   - Framework works with any codebase
   - No modification needed for different projects
   - Just place code in `codebase/` directory

2. **Flexible Analysis**
   - Analyze multiple repos as unified system
   - Focus on specific repository when needed
   - Easy switching between scopes

3. **Token Optimization**
   - Repomix combines files into single document
   - 80% token reduction maintained
   - Cross-repository context in one file

4. **Simple Management**
   - Add/remove repositories anytime
   - Reconfigure with setup script
   - No manual editing required

## Testing the Configuration

### Verify Current Setup
```bash
# Check current configuration
cat .mcp.json | grep project

# Should show either:
# "${PWD}/codebase"           (for all repos)
# "${PWD}/codebase/repo-name" (for specific)
```

### Test Repomix
```bash
# Generate combined file
repomix --config .repomix.config.json

# Check output
ls -la output/reports/*.md
```

### Reconfigure
```bash
# Change scope
python3 framework/scripts/setup_mcp.py

# Select option 1 or 2
# Restart Claude Code after changes
```

## Summary

The framework is now:
- ✅ Completely repository-agnostic
- ✅ No hardcoded repository names
- ✅ Supports multiple repositories
- ✅ Repomix properly configured for combined output
- ✅ Flexible configuration through setup script
- ✅ Ready for any codebase structure
