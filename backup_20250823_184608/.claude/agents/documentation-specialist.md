@Service
@Transactional
public class CustomerService {
  // Migrated business logic from EJB
}
```

```jsp
<%-- Legacy JSP with embedded logic --%>
<% if (customer.isActive()) { %>
    <p>Customer is active</p>
<% } %>
```

```html
<!-- Modern Angular template -->
<p *ngIf="customer.isActive">Customer is active</p>
```
```

### Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)
```markdown
# ADR-001: Database Technology Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to select a database technology for the modernized customer management system. Current legacy system uses Oracle, but we want to evaluate modern alternatives.

## Decision
We will use PostgreSQL as the primary database for the new system.

## Consequences
**Positive:**
- Reduced licensing costs
- Better performance for our use cases
- Strong community support
- Excellent JSON support for flexible schemas

**Negative:**
- Team needs training on PostgreSQL-specific features
- Migration complexity from Oracle
- Need to establish new backup and monitoring procedures
